Supplementary material: Tables S3 and S4. Summary statistics of ABBA/BABA introgression tests conducted on modern individuals of date palms, their known closely related species and the ancient Saqqara date palm leaf using as reference a highly fragmented (Tab. S3) and a contiguous (Tab. S4) genome assemblies. Orange cells denote D-statistics supporting introgression between the Saqqara leaf geome and P. theophrasti. Blue cells represent D-statistics supporting introgression between modern P. dactylifera individuals and P. theophrasti
